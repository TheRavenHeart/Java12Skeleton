arrayequals.java: This comes from the java.util package checks to see if the arrays that are specified are the same

arrayinitialize.java: This initlizes and prints out the array

arrayinitialize2.java: A differnt way of initlizing and printing, it also limits how many numbers can go into the array

arraysort.java: This sorts out the numbers in the array , in the code here its in ascending numerical order

breakoutwhilenested.java: it allows you to break out of an outer loop if you use it inside of a child loop

bufferedreaderinput.java: The Buffered reader can only read characters. It is also more effecient in cases where you have to use multithred.

continueexample.java: Restarts the innermost while loop in this string of code it restarts every time the number is divisble by three

copyarray.java: copies an array in a specifed source array, In this case its smallprimes and changes lucknumbers 1002, 1003, 1004 and changes it to 5, 7, 9

doloop.java: A doloop is a loop where the condition is checked at the end 

foreachloop.java: This is an easier way to pirint out all he elements.

foreachmulti.java: foreachmulti lets you print out each array in the magicsquare

forloop.java: A prgram that loops from x=1 to x=9 and prints out x*5

functionvoid.java: This is a program adds two ints together and prints them out

globalconstant.java: Allows you to specify a varible that does not change and that you can acess throughout your program 

ifstatement.java: An if statement is a statment that allows you to set a condtion that controls program flow 

joptionpaneinput.java: the program promt you for input in a gui window

localconstant.java: Allows you to set a varible as unchanging within a scope

logic.java: This checks boolean expressions

mainargsarray.java: a way to get input from the terminal

mathoperatorsfunctions.java: demonstrates functions from the math library

multidimensionalarray.java: This initializes a two dimension array and uses a nested loop to print it out

nesteddowhile.java: uses a nested dowhile loop to outputs times tables 

nestedfor.java: The above but using nested for loops

nestedif.java:uses nested if statments to control the output based o nthe value of two varibles

nestedswitchstatement.java: A program to find the values of two varibles using a nested switch statment

nestedwhile.java: Like do while program but checks the condition before moving forward

overloadedfunction.java: demonstrats a function with the same name but diffrent parameter types

raggedarray.java: An array that is initlized in a way that is inefficent

randomnumber.java: demonstrates the math.random function to display a pseudo-random number

reinitializearray.java: demonstrates an array of number then reinilizting the array using the new keyword

scannerinput.java: demonstrats using the scanner to get an input

searcharray.java: searches for a specific number in an array using binarySearch on an sorted array

stringtonumber.java: using the value of function to change data types to String

switchstatement.java: An example of a switch statment

typecast.java: another way to convert data in to data types

types.java: Displays all of the basic data types as well as String

whileloop.java: THE SIMPLEST WHILE LOOP(outputs the 5 times able from 1 to 9)
